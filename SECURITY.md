## ❗ Vulnerability Management

We employ several security measures to maintain the integrity of our codebase:

- **Automated Scanning**: We use GitHub's Dependabot and CodeQL for continuous security monitoring
- **Regular Updates**: Dependencies are kept up-to-date to patch known vulnerabilities
- **Code Review**: All pull requests undergo security review before merging

## 🔐 Reporting a Security Vulnerability

We take security issues seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue
2. Email us immediately at security@cloudcommunityclub.in
3. Include detailed information about the vulnerability
4. If possible, provide steps to reproduce the issue

For urgent matters, contact our team through:
- Discord: [Join our Discord Server](https://discord.gg/YOUR_INVITE_LINK)
- Email: security@cloudcommunityclub.in

We commit to:
- Acknowledging your report within 24 hours
- Providing regular updates on our progress
- Notifying you when the issue is resolved
- Crediting you in our security acknowledgments (unless you prefer to remain anonymous)

## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

1. Never commit sensitive information (API keys, credentials, etc.)
2. Keep dependencies updated
3. Follow our coding standards and security guidelines
4. Report any suspicious activity immediately
